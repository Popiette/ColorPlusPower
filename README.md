# ColorPlusPower
CPP is a little program to easily print colored text in CLI, and pimp you shell scripts. :p

It has no real purpose. But if you find it useful cool or funny, you are free to use it. =)

# How to install

CPP requires TCLAP to parse arguments.
You can find TCLAP [over here](tclap.sourceforge.net). Follow the classic procedure :

* go to the tclap directory after extracting it.
* ```./configure```
* ```make```
* ```make install```

Once TCLAP is compiled & installed, clone this repo, and use make to compile.

For now, I haven't made a make installation. I'll try to make one in the future.
